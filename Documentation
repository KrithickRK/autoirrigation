# User Manual

## Overview

This document provides a guide on how to set up and use the auto irrigation system.

## Components

1. Tensiometer
2. Relay module
3. Arduino (or compatible microcontroller)
4. IoT platform for monitoring

## Setup Instructions

1. Connect the tensiometer to the analog pin A0.
2. Connect the relay module to digital pin 7.
3. Upload the firmware to the microcontroller.
4. Run the IoT integration script to monitor system status.

## Troubleshooting

- **Pump Not Turning On:**
  - Verify that the relay module is correctly wired and functioning.
  - Ensure the power supply to the water pump is adequate.

- **Inconsistent Soil Moisture Readings:**
  - Check the calibration of the tensiometer and ensure it is properly installed in the soil.

- **Serial Monitor Not Displaying Data:**
  - Confirm that the correct baud rate (9600) is selected in the Serial Monitor.

## Usage

The system will automatically turn on the irrigation when the soil moisture level drops below 30%. You can monitor and control the system via the IoT platform.
